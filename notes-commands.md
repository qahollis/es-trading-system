# Terminal Commands Reference

## Navigation
- `cd foldername` — Change Directory. Moves you into a folder. Think of it like double-clicking a folder in File Explorer except you stay in the terminal.
- `cd ..` — Moves you one level up. If you are in `pipeline` this takes you back to `es-trading-system`.
- `ls` — List. Shows everything in your current folder — files and subfolders. Your equivalent of opening a folder in File Explorer and seeing what is inside.
- `ls filename` — checks a file in your current folder
- `ls subfolder\filename` — checks a file inside a subfolder
- `ls subfolder` — lists all contents of a subfolder
- `pwd` — Print Working Directory. Shows you exactly where you currently are in the folder structure. Useful when you are lost.
- `code .` — opens VS Code in the current terminal folder

## File and Folder Management
- `mkdir foldername` — Make Directory. Creates a new folder.
- `move source destination` — Moves a file or folder from one location to another.
- `Remove-Item filename` — Deletes a file. Add `-Force` to override protection. Add `-Recurse` to delete a folder and everything inside it.
- `copy source destination` — Copies a file without removing the original.
- `type filename` — Prints the contents of a file directly in the terminal. Useful for quickly checking what is inside a small file like your `.env`.
`New-Item filename` - Creates a new empty file in the current directory
`New-Item filename1, filename2` - Creates multiple new files at once
